# CONTEXT

## Product purpose

`supa-pi` is Ethan's personal-but-reusable Pi agent harness. It curates local Pi extensions, specialized agents, reusable skills, prompt templates, and rule packs to make Pi sessions more capable and consistent.

The repository is optimized for local workflow quality and maintainable agent behavior, not public-package stability.

## Domain model

- **Extension** — a Pi runtime module registered through `package.json -> pi.extensions`. Extensions add commands, tools, UI behavior, or workflow prompts.
- **Command** — a slash-command interface exposed by an Extension.
- **Agent** — a specialized subagent definition under `agents/` used for delegated work.
- **Skill** — reusable task-specific instructions under `skills/` or imported skill locations.
- **Domain-modeling skill** — reusable canonical semantic primitive under `skills/domain-modeling/` that owns terminology sharpening, scenario testing, contradiction discovery, boundary analysis, and ADR-candidacy assessment.
- **Context-docs workflow** — sole owner of durable-context routing, formats, commands, and persistence; it consumes completed domain-modeling packets without delegating them back.
- **Rule pack** — coding, testing, security, or workflow guidance under `rules/`.
- **Prompt template** — durable prompt text under `prompts/` or an extension-local prompt file.
- **Setup script** — `setup.sh`, which prepares the live Pi agent environment.
- **Companion package** — external Pi package installed by `setup.sh` to extend the local harness.

## Domain glossary

- **Active Extension** — an Extension currently listed in `package.json -> pi.extensions`.
- **Disabled Extension** — extension code present in the repo but not listed in `package.json -> pi.extensions`.
- **Live Pi config** — the runtime Pi agent directory under `~/.pi/agent`.
- **Development clone** — any checkout used for editing this repo. It does not have to be `~/.pi/agent`.
- **Core orchestration contract** — always-on main-session policy for autonomy, direct-versus-delegated work, verification, and output behavior. _Avoid_: routing rule, workflow rule.
- **Agent role contract** — a delegated worker's responsibility, tools, model, boundaries, and output contract; reusable implementation methodology belongs in a Skill. _Avoid_: methodology agent.
- **Workflow skill** — reusable task procedure loaded only when the work matches, shared by direct and delegated execution when applicable. _Avoid_: specialist worker, routing policy.
- **Task rule** — selectively loaded user or project policy defining when guidance applies and which outcomes are required; it does not own always-on orchestration routing. _Avoid_: dispatcher, agent catalog.
- **TDD Slice** — one atomic managed behavior-change task that receives the canonical TDD skill as its preferred strategy and owns one distinct test target plus its production target(s). Strict RED/GREEN evidence may complete directly; trustworthy strategy deviations require independent verification. _Avoid_: test task, implementation task, TDD phase.
- **Task-shape declaration** — the closed `tddShape` contract for a TDD Slice: intended behavior, RED/GREEN command, production component, and 2-6 ordered canonical test-before-production mutation operations. It is required if and only if `tdd: true`; settled command or mutation drift is verification evidence, not automatically a hard failure. _Avoid_: task plan, file estimate, mutation budget.
- **Matt-compatible context docs** — `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, `docs/adr/`, and optional `docs/context/` notes.

## Product constraints

- Keep extension boundaries isolated. Extensions under `extensions/` should not import from sibling extensions unless explicitly refactored into shared non-extension code.
- Prefer small, durable Markdown context over chat-only decisions.
- Develop anywhere, but treat `~/.pi/agent` as the live Pi config location described by setup docs.
- Pi 0.84 or newer owns regular/fullscreen viewport composition. SupaPi defaults newly created settings to fullscreen, supports both modes, and does not rewrite existing TUI-mode preferences.
- Do not document secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, or raw sensitive logs.
- Root project license is MIT. Copied or adapted upstream materials must carry source and license notices in durable docs or README entries.
- Domain modeling is skill composition, not a command or production runtime registration; grilling invokes it only when explicit domain signals arise.

## Open questions
